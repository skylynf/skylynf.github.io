## TensorACO: Tensorized Ant Colony Optimization for GPU Acceleration
### Advisor: [Prof. Ran Cheng](https://chengran.tech/) | Sept. 2023 till now
(First Author, Under reviewing)

- We propose an ant system tensorization method. It integrates heuristic method values and the pheromone matrices to compute the probability transition matrix, enabling efficient preprocessing while achieving acceleration using function mapping.
- We propose an ant path tensorization method. It parallelizes the serial processing of ant path solutions in the pheromone matrix computation and reduces redundant path cost calculations through an index mapping method.
- We propose an Adaptive Independent Roulette (AdaIR) method. It improves algorithm performance while retaining the benefits of parallelization by incorporating a learning rate hyperparameter to dynamically adjust the tendency of ants to select cities with higher probabilities.
- Compared with the sequential ACO in CPU, a 1921$\times$ acceleration was achieved; AdaIR achieved an additional acceleration of more than 2$\times$.
