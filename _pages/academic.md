## TensorACO: GPU-Accelerated Tensorized Ant Colony Optimization Algorithm
### Advisor: [Prof. Ran Cheng](https://chengran.tech/) | Sept. 2023 till now

- Implemented an algorithm adhering to functional programming and Google's JAX standards.
- Orchestrated the entire algorithm process to be tensorized and deterministic.
- Offered a more versatile GPU-Accelerated solution compared to traditional parallel ACOs.

### Detail:

TensorACO is notable for its elegance, simplicity, and scalability. With tensorization, the method optimized acceleration **89** times compared to serialization methods with no loss of solution quality. New exploration of the i-roulette method of choosing movement has produced substantial findings, achieved an extra acceleration of **2.12x**.
