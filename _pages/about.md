Intro:
An interesting guy who majored in computer science.
The undergraduate research direction is Evolutionary Computation and GPU-accelerating Algorithm. 
As a passionate person, sunny and cheerful, committed to helping others, has done a lot of volunteer services, and has strong leadership skills.
GPA was relatively low, but did a good job in the course projects and received full marks for many professional courses.
Am not keen on GPA calculation, and carefully complete all the homework after class on my own, so often don't get high homework points.
Competed with many people whose GPAs were greater than 3.8 and won the university's motto scholarship, very proud of it.
