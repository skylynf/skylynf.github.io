I am currently a Ph.D. student and Research Associate at The Ohio State University, working with [Prof. Alper Yilmaz](https://ceg.osu.edu/people/yilmaz.15) in the [Photogrammetric Computer Vision Lab](https://u.osu.edu/pcvlab/). My research focuses on computer vision, interdisciplinary AI, and AI for science and social impact.

Broadly, I am interested in developing intelligent systems that connect visual understanding with real-world applications, bridging data-driven methods and domain knowledge to advance both scientific discovery and societal well-being.
