## **"Glimmer in SUSTech": First Aid Knowledge Outreach Project (project leader):**
### 2021 till now

As the project leader of the "Glimmer in SUSTech" First Aid Knowledge Outreach Project, I led a dedicated team in providing comprehensive first aid training to both university students and residents in the surrounding communities. The training encompassed essential skills such as AED operation, CPR, wound dressing, and other first aid knowledge.

Within the campus of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), we conducted over 30 sessions, reaching a total of more than 3,200 individuals. Our training sessions covered the entire freshman population over three years, earning widespread acclaim. Additionally, we recruited over 600 students, empowering them to serve as the first responders for medical emergencies on campus.

Beyond the university borders, we extended our outreach to six local communities, including BaoShiZhou East Community and LongGuang Community in Shenzhen. Here, we provided vital first aid knowledge training to approximately 220 residents. Our commitment to delivering thorough and responsible training garnered encouragement and praise from the community members.

In this role, I not only assumed the responsibility of a primary instructor but also actively engaged in community partnerships, fostering a culture of preparedness and support. The success of the project highlights our dedication to promoting health and safety both within and beyond the university campus.


## Campus Volunteer First Aid Responder 
### 2020 till now

- Responded to over 60 emergencies with an average response time of less than 3 minutes.
- Effectively managed diverse situations, including suspected cases of epilepsy, fractures, trauma, heatstroke, hyperventilation, and snake bites.
- Honored with 'SUSTech Emergency Rescue Model' for outstanding contributions, twice.

In September 2020, I joined the Southern University of Science and Technology Emergency Rescue Association (SERA). In October of the same year, I obtained certification as a Red Cross first aid responder. Joining the "First Responder" volunteer team, I promptly engaged in handling emergencies and providing pre-hospital first aid.

Over the past three years, I have responded to nearly a hundred emergencies, successfully managing various situations, including several suspected cases of epilepsy, fractures, external injuries, heatstroke, and hyperventilation. The average response time was less than three minutes, earning me recognition as a reliable and professional first responder. Teachers at the university have commended me as being "professional and dependable."

Outside the campus, I volunteered on three occasions to assist passengers in need on high-speed trains and subways.

On campus, I actively organized and participated in various safety assurance volunteer services, including safety coverage for numerous sports events. Additionally, I played a crucial role in the safety assurance for three years of undergraduate military training, successfully handling emergencies such as snake bites, heat syncope, and acute hypokalemia. These efforts resulted in multiple commendations as a "Model in Emergency Rescue" from the university.

In maintaining campus first aid facilities, I volunteered to inspect and maintain AED devices regularly. This involved inspecting hundreds of AEDs on campus, conducting more than 10 self-checks on AED devices, and identifying and resolving issues with four AED devices.

As a "First Responder" volunteer, I actively participated in various training programs to enhance my knowledge and volunteer service capabilities. This included emergency first aid training at Shenzhen General Hospital, participation in events like the "5G Greater Bay Area Aviation Rescue Emergency Drill" and the "China Emergency Peak Forum." I obtained certifications from the American Heart Association (AHA) for on-site first aid, CPR, and defibrillator operation. I also acquired an amateur radio operator's license at my own expense, along with the Guangdong Province radio station license, laying a solid foundation for participating in emergency rescue volunteer services. In my spare time, I underwent training with the Shenzhen Red Cross to become a certified Chinese Red Cross emergency first aid instructor.

At the same time, I applied my personal expertise to the popularization of first aid. I used my computer programming knowledge to design a first responder system that can visually view the nearest AED on campus in real time. At the same time, I can ask for help with one click and contact the nearest first responder to implement rescue.
